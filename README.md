## ‚ùîWhat

This is a tool for Redirecting your local Mass Effect 3 clients to an Unofficial server. The
connection string you put in will be connected to by the client and then used to redirect
traffic using the system hosts file

## ‚ùîUsage Guide

For a guide on using this program see the guide [Here](https://pocket-relay.pages.dev/guide/client/)


## ‚ùîHow

This tool uses the system hosts file at `C:/Windows/System32/drivers/etc/hosts` and adds
`127.0.0.1 gosredirector.ea.com` which tells your computer to send all the traffic that
would normally go to `gosredirector.ea.com` to your local computer where its then instead handled by the client tool

## üîå Credits

This client application embeds the [https://github.com/Erik-JS/masseffect-binkw32](https://github.com/Erik-JS/masseffect-binkw32) patch DLLs in order to make its redirection work
