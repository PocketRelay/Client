# Pocket Relay Client

![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/PocketRelay/Client?style=for-the-badge)

## ‚ùîWhat

This is a tool for Redirecting your local Mass Effect 3 clients to an Unofficial server. The
connection string you put in will be connected to by the client and then used to redirect
traffic using the system hosts file

## Connection strings

These are the urls you place in the tool. This url is an HTTP url to the HTTP server running on
the Pocket Relay server. You can ommit the http:// when making the request. Make sure if you 
are a server owner who has changed the port that you include the port in the conneciton string

### Example With Default Port

#### Domain
test.com

> Note: When using domains if the IP changes the client tool will need to be used again
> to update the IP address as the IP address is only resolved at the initial update. This
> is a limitation of the Hosts file

#### Directly use IP address
127.0.0.1

### Example With Custom Port

These examples are for if you are using a custom port for this example
the port is changed to 8080

#### Domain
test.com:8080

#### Directly use IP address
127.0.0.1:8080+

## ‚ùîHow

This tool uses the system hosts file at `C:/Windows/System32/drivers/etc/hosts` and adds
`127.0.0.1 gosredirector.ea.com` which tells your computer to send all the traffic that
would normally go to `gosredirector.ea.com` to the host that you provide through the
connection string
